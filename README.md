Introduction
------------

XaoS is a realtime interactive fractal zoomer. This means that it lets you
zoom smoothly into any place in the fractal you choose without the long 
calculation required by most other fractal generators. It has many other 
features too, like different fractal types, autopilot, special coloring
modes, random palette generation, color cycling, etc.

User Support
------------

XaoS is a community-supported free software project. 
The [xaos-users](http://groups.google.com/group/xaos-users) Google Group 
provides a place for XaoS users to help each other get the most out of XaoS. 
XaoS developers also monitor this discussion and answer questions from time to time.

You can browse the archives freely but to prevent spam, you must join the group 
in order to post. Google Groups provides options for participation from a 
traditional mailing list to a completely web-based forum, so you don’t have to 
get emails if you don’t want to.

Reporting Bugs
--------------

Issues are tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/xaos-project/XaoS/issues).
If you think you have found a bug in XaoS or have an idea for a new feature, 
please let us know about it. 

XaoS is developed on a volunteer basis and the developers work on it in their spare time. 
Therefore, we can’t guarantee that issues will be addressed in a certain timeframe. If 
you are able to fix a bug yourself, pull requests are very welcome.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

XaoS is based on Qt, and supports Linux, Mac, and Windows.

XaoS is transitioning from gettext to Qt for i18n.  Until all of the files
containing translatable text can be converted to C++, we will still use
po/pot files to store the translations, while using Qt lrelease to generate
qm files from the po files for release. Eventually, the plan is to move 
fully to Qt Linguist.
